# 🧠 Task 2 – Deep Learning Based Image Classification  
A Project Submitted for CodTech Data Science Internship

This project implements a Deep Learning model to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the *MNIST dataset. The code is written in Python using **TensorFlow/Keras* and executed in **Jupyter Notebook (task2 (1).ipynb).


## 📁 Files in This Repository
- 📓 task2 (1).ipynb — Main Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and visualizations  
- 📊 mnist_train_small (1).csv — Training dataset (or zip version if over 25 MB)  
- 📊 mnist_test (1).csv — Test dataset  
- 📄 README.md — Project overview and execution guide


## 🔧 Tech Stack Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 📘 Jupyter Notebook  
- 🤖 TensorFlow & Keras  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn


## ✅ Features
- ✔ Loaded MNIST digit data from CSV files  
- ✔ Built a Deep Neural Network using Keras Sequential API  
- ✔ Trained the model with validation split  
- ✔ Evaluated using accuracy, loss & confusion matrix  
- ✔ Visualized predictions and performance metrics  
- ✔ Achieved over *98% test accuracy*


## 🖼 Output Highlights
- 📉 Training vs Validation Accuracy & Loss graphs  
- 🧩 Confusion Matrix Heatmap  
- 🔢 Digit Predictions with Actual Labels  
- 📌 Clean, well-commented, and readable code


## 🚀 How to Run This Project
1. Upload the following files to *Google Colab* or run in *Jupyter Notebook*:
   - task2 (1).ipynb
   - mnist_train_small (1).csv (or .zip version if applicable)
   - mnist_test (1).csv

2. Install the required libraries (if not already):
   ```bash
  
3. Run all cells to train the model and view the output visualizations.
